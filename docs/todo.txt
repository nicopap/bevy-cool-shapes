Symbols:
!!: Will happen
??: Possibility, future exploration
**: Alternative to keep in mind, even if decision was made to not do it

Code quality:
* !! Remove the weird `match_2d` and `match_3d` macros
* ?? Direct conversion from shapes to `DebugShapeOutline`

Design:
* ?? separate `Display`, `Shape` and `density` in their own components
* ** Use `Transform::scale` for size, and otherwise keep shapes stupid simple
  by only defining their unit versions. Polyline seems to be smart and keep
  the proper line width despite the scaling

Functionalities:
* !! implementation of debug shape removal
* !! implementation of debug shape update
* !! implementation of debug shape update following `Visibility` modifier on the parent
  entity on which the `DebugShape` component was added
* !! Add Fill (3d mesh with surfaces)
* !! Add a toggle for depth checking, for both line and filled rendering separately.
